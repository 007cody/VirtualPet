Penguin
=============

In this project you will write a program using [code.org game lab](https://code.org/educate/gamelab) that displays a penguin or any other animal of your choice. You can use any drawing functions that you would like, you may find slides 33 - 50 of the [Computer Programming A slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fm_Di0qR4HpRWTf8tJtcW3u5by3OrilfXIPZ517K1js/edit?usp=sharing) helpful. The precise picture you draw is entirely up to you -- have fun and be creative!
